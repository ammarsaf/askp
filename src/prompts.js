            - 2 is low Rating, quite negative, dissatistified and disagree answer.
            - 3 is middle rating, neutral, satisfied, yet not agree and disagreement.
            - 4 is high rating, quite positive, satisfied and agree with the answer.
            - 5 is highest rating, the most postive, satisfied and very agree with the answer.
    - Impact: Impact value is the weight of the question on how the the question's topic will impact the user
     in his/her future marriage. It does not indicate the Rating of the user towards the potential partner.
    It's a value chose by the user, to state how important is the question and how it could impact
    the marriage in the future. 
    Impact's option can be - "Tolerable", "Non-tolerable" and "None".
        - "Tolerable" means the user can tolerate with the answer of the potential partner, expecting neither high nor low.
        - "Non-tolerable" means the user cannot tolerate with the answer of the potential partner, expecting high rating.
        - "None" means the question has no Impact.
        - For example
            - If rating 1 and Impact is Tolerable, the user is not satisfied however it does not give a huge impact
            towards the marriage, which is quite negative, but can be tolerate.
            - If rating 5 and Impact is Tolerable, the user is very satisfied however it does not give a huge impact
            towards the marriage, but it is quite positive that can help understanding.
            - If rating 1 and Impact is Non-tolerable, the user is very dissatisfied and it will give a huge negative impact
            towards the marriage.

    {
        "Thought": "Overall analysis considering all questions, ratings, and Impact.",
        "Positive": "Positive aspects of the partner's answers (high ratings + high Impact).",
        "Negative": "Negative aspects of the partner's answers (low ratings + high Impact).",
        "Result": "Suitable" | "Not-Suitable" 
    }

    You can give your commentary based on both Rating and Impact as the 'Thought' value,
    positive side based on both Rating for the potential partner and Impact choice of the user in 'Positive' value,
    negative side based on both Rating for the potential partner and Impact choice of the user in 'Negative value,
    and conclude whether the users's potential partner is 'Suitable' or 'Not-Suitable' as the value
    of the 'Result' based on the value of 'Positive' and 'Negative' thought you have

    Rules for Evaluation:
    Focus on questions where:
    - "Impact" is "Non-tolerable" AND "Rating" is low (1-2): Strong negative impact.
    - "Impact" is "Non-tolerable" AND "Rating" is high (4-5): Strong positive impact.
    - "Impact" is "Tolerable": Moderate impact (low ratings are less critical).
    - "Impact" is "None": Ignore (no impact on the result).
    - The "Result" should be "Not-Suitable" if:
        - There are any "Non-tolerable" questions with a rating â‰¤ 2.
        - The overall negatives outweigh the positives.
    - Otherwise, the "Result" is "Suitable".
